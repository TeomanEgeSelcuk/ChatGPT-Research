# ChatGPT-Research

The present research aims to assess the proficiency of ChatGPT, which is acknowledged as one of the most sophisticated and prevalent artificial intelligence technologies available today, in addressing both complex and straightforward mathematical computations and questions that require cognitive effort. The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the efficacy of ChatGPT in facilitating students' acquisition and comprehension of mathematical concepts. We are specifically interested in math questions relating to the topic Sequences and Series. To conduct our research, we will be using a variety of textbooks. We will be collecting and selecting a variety of cognitively demanding and simple mathematical questions, which we will then pass on to ChatGPT to compute and record the answers. We will then give the answers generated by ChatGPT to Math professors at TMU for grading.
